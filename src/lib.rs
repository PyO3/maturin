//! Builds wheels from a crate that exposes python bindings through pyo3
//!
//! The high-level api is [BuildOptions], which can be converted into the [BuildContext], which
//! then uses [compile()] and builds the appropriate wheels.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! Default features: log, upload, rustls, human-panic
//!
//! - log: Configures pretty-env-logger, even though maturin doesn't use logging itself.
//!
//! - upload: Uses reqwest to add the upload command.
//!
//! - rustls: Makes reqwest use the rustls stack so that we can build maturin in a CentOS 6
//! docker container and which maturin itself manylinux compliant.
//!
//! - human-panic: Adds https://github.com/rust-clique/human-panic
//!
//! - password-storage (off by default): Uses the keyring package to store the password. keyring
//! pulls in a lot of shared libraries and outdated dependencies, so this is off by default, except
//! for the build on the github releases page.
