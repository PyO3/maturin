Build and publish crates with pyo3, rust-cpython and cffi bindings as well as rust binaries as python packages.

This project was meant as a zero configuration replacement for [setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust). It supports building wheels for python 2.7 and 3.5+ on windows, linux and mac and can upload them to [pypi](https://pypi.org/).

## Usage

You can either download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3-pack/releases/latest) or install it with pip:

```shell
pip install pyo3-pack
```

You can also install pyo3-pack from source, though it's an older version:

```shell
cargo install pyo3-pack
```

There are three main subcommands:

 * `publish` builds the crate into python packages and publishes them to pypi.
 * `build` builds the wheels and stores them in a folder (`target/wheels` by default), but doesn't upload them.
 * `develop` builds the crate and install it's as a python module directly in the current virtualenv

`pyo3` and `rust-cpython` bindings are automatically detected, for cffi or binaries you need to pass `-b cffi` or `-b bin`. pyo3-pack needs no extra configuration files, and also doesn't clash with an existing setuptools-rust or milksnake configuration. You can even integrate it with testing tools such as tox (see `get-fourtytwo` for an example).

The name of the package will be the name of the cargo project, i.e. the name field in the `[package]` section of Cargo.toml. The name of the module, which you are using when importing, will be the `name` value in the `[lib]` section (which defaults to the name of the package). For binaries it's simply the name of the binary generated by cargo.

Pip allows adding so called console scripts, which are shell commands that execute some function in you program. You can add console scripts in a section `[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]`. The keys are the script names while the values are the path to the function in the format `some.module.path:class.function`, where the `class` part is optional. The function is called with no arguments. Example:

```toml
[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]
get_42 = "get_fourtytwo:DummyClass.get_42"
```

You can also specify [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) in your Cargo.toml under `package.metadata.pyo3-pack.classifier`, e.g.:

```toml
[package.metadata.pyo3-pack]
classifier = ["Programming Language :: Python"]
```

## pyo3 and rust-cpython

For pyo3 and rust-cpython, pyo3-pack can only build packages for installed python versions. On linux and mac, all python versions in `PATH` are used. If you don't set your own interpreters with `-i`, a heuristic is used to search for python installations. On windows all versions from the python launcher (which is installed by default by the python.org installer) and all conda environments except base are used. You can check which versions are picked up with the `list-python` subcommand.

## Cffi

 Cffi wheels are compatible with all python versions, but they need to have `cffi` installed for the python used for building (`pip install cffi`).

pyo3-pack will run cbindgen and generate cffi bindings. You can override this with a build script that writes a header to `target/header.h`.

<details>
<summary>Example of a custom build script</summary>

```rust
use cbindgen; // Use `extern crate cbindgen` in rust 2015
use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    let bindings = cbindgen::Builder::new()
        .with_no_includes()
        .with_language(cbindgen::Language::C)
        .with_crate(crate_dir)
        .generate()
        .unwrap();
    bindings.write_to_file(Path::new("target").join("header.h"));
}
```

</details>

## Manylinux and auditwheel

For portability reasons, native python modules on linux must only dynamically link a set of very few libraries which are installed basically everywhere, hence the name manylinux. The pypa offers a special docker container and a tool called [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/) to ensure compliance with the [manylinux rules](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/#the-manylinux1-policy).

pyo3-pack contains a reimplementation of a major part of auditwheel automatically checking the generated library. If you want to disable those checks or build for native linux target, use the `--manylinux` flag.

For full manylinux compliance you need to compile in a cent os 5 docker container. The [konstin2/pyo3-pack](https://hub.docker.com/r/konstin2/pyo3-pack) image is based on the official manylinux image. You can use it like this:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io konstin2/pyo3-pack build
```

pyo3-pack itself is manylinux compliant when compiled for the musl target. The binaries on the release pages have additional keyring integration (through the `password-storage` feature), which is not manylinux compliant.

## Code

The main part is the pyo3-pack library, which is completely documented and should be well integratable. The accompanying `main.rs` takes care username and password for the pypi upload and otherwise calls into the library.

There are three different examples, which are also used for integration testing: `get_fourtytwo` with pyo3 bindings, `points` crate with cffi bindings and `hello-world` as a binary. The `sysconfig` folder contains the output of `python -m sysconfig` for different python versions and platform, which is helpful during development.

You need to install `virtualenv` and `cffi` (`pip install virtualenv cffi`) to run the tests.

You might want to have look into my [blog post](https://blog.schuetze.link/2018/07/21/a-dive-into-packaging-native-python-extensions.html) which explains the intricacies of building native python packages.
