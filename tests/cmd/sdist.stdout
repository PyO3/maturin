Build only a source distribution (sdist) without compiling.

Building a source distribution requires a pyproject.toml with a `[build-system]` table.

This command is a workaround for [pypa/pip#6041](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041)

Usage: maturin[EXE] sdist [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -m, --manifest-path <MANIFEST_PATH>
          The path to the Cargo.toml

  -o, --out <OUT>
          The directory to store the built wheels in. Defaults to a new "wheels" directory in the
          project's target directory

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
