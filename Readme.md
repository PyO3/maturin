Build and publish crates with pyo3, rust-cpython and cffi bindings as well as rust binaries as python packages.

This project was meant as a zero configuration replacement for [setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust). It supports building wheels for python 2.7 and 3.5+ on windows, linux and mac and can upload them to [pypi](https://pypi.org/).

## Usage

You can either download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3-pack/releases/latest) or install it from source:

```shell
cargo install pyo3-pack
```

You can also install pyo3-pack with pip:

```shell
pip install pyo3-pack
```

There are three main subsommands:

 * `publish` builds the crate into python packages and publishes them to pypi.
 * `build` builds the wheels and stores them in a folder (`target/wheels` by default), but doesn't upload them.
 * `develop` builds the crate and install it's as a python module directly in the current virtualenv

`pyo3` and `rust-cpython` bindings are automatically detected, for cffi or binaries you need to pass `-b cffi` or `-b bin`. pyo3-pack needs no extra configuration files, and also doesn't clash with an existing setuptools-rust or milksnake configuration. You can even integrate it with testing tools such as tox (see `get-fourtytwo` for an example).

The name of the package will be the name of the cargo project, i.e. the name field in the `[package]` section of Cargo.toml. The name of the module, which you are using when importing, will be the `name` value in the `[lib]` section (which defaults to the name of the package). For binaries it's simply the name of the binary generated by cargo.

Pip allows adding so called console scripts, which are shell commands that execute some function in you program. You can add console scripts in a section `[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]`. The keys are the script names while the values are the path to the function in the format `some.module.path:class.function`, where the `class` part is optional. The function is called with no arguments. Example:

```toml
[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]
get_42 = "get_fourtytwo:DummyClass.get_42"
```

For pyo3 and rust-cpython, pyo3-pack can only build packages for installed python versions, so you might want to use pyenv, deadsnakes or docker for building. If you don't set your own interpreters with `-i`, a heuristic is used to search for python installations. You can get a list of those with the `list-python` subcommand. cffi wheels are compatible with all python versions, but they need to have `cffi` installed to build (`pip install cffi`).

## Cffi

For crates with cffi you need to use a build script that writes c headers to a file called `target/header.h` until [eqrion/cbdingen#203](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/issues/203) is resolved:

```rust
extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    let mut config: cbindgen::Config = Default::default();
    config.language = cbindgen::Language::C;
    cbindgen::generate_with_config(&crate_dir, config)
        .expect("Unable to generate bindings")
        .write_to_file(Path::new("target").join("header.h"));
}
```

## Manylinux and auditwheel

For portability reasons, native python modules on linux must only dynamically link a set of very few libraries which are installed basically everywhere, hence the name manylinux. The pypa offers a special docker container and a tool called [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/) to ensure compliance with the [manylinux rules](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/#the-manylinux1-policy). pyo3-pack contains a reimplementation of the most important part of auditwheel that checks the generated library, so there's no need to use external tools. If you want to disable the manylinux compliance checks for some reason, use the `--skip-auditwheel` flag.

To ship a completely static binary with musl, you can use `pyo3-pack build -b bin --cargo-extra-args="--target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"`.

Note that the pyo3-pack pip package is not manylinux compliant (A compliant package could neither upload not use the keyring)

## Code

The main part is the pyo3-pack library, which is completely documented and should be well integratable. The accompanying `main.rs` takes care username and password for the pypi upload and otherwise calls into the library.

Without the `upload` and `password-storage` features, pyo3-pack itself is manylinux compliant (and has much less dependencies).

There are three different examples, which are also used for integration testing: `get_fourtytwo` with pyo3 bindings, `points` crate with cffi bindings and `hello-world` as a binary. The `sysconfig` folder contains the output of `python -m sysconfig` for different python versions and platform, which is helpful during development.

You need to install `virtualenv` and `cffi` (`pip install virtualenv cffi`) to run the tests.

You might want to have look into my [blog post](https://blog.schuetze.link/2018/07/21/a-dive-into-packaging-native-python-extensions.html) which explains the intricacies of building native python packages.
