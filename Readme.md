Build and publish crates with pyo3, rust-cpython and cffi bindings as well as rust binaries as python packages.

This project is meant as a zero configuration replacement for [setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) and [milksnake](https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake). It supports building wheels for python 3.5+ on windows, linux and mac, can upload them to [pypi](https://pypi.org/) and has basic pypy support.

## Usage

You can either download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3-pack/releases/latest) or install it with pip:

```shell
pip install pyo3-pack
```

There are three main commands:

 * `pyo3-pack publish` builds the crate into python packages and publishes them to pypi.
 * `pyo3-pack build` builds the wheels and stores them in a folder (`target/wheels` by default), but doesn't upload them.
 * `pyo3-pack develop` builds the crate and install it's as a python module directly in the current virtualenv.

`pyo3` and `rust-cpython` bindings are automatically detected, for cffi or binaries you need to pass `-b cffi` or `-b bin`. pyo3-pack needs no extra configuration files, and also doesn't clash with an existing setuptools-rust or milksnake configuration. You can even integrate it with testing tools such as tox (see `pyo3-pure` for an example).

The name of the package will be the name of the cargo project, i.e. the name field in the `[package]` section of Cargo.toml. The name of the module, which you are using when importing, will be the `name` value in the `[lib]` section (which defaults to the name of the package). For binaries it's simply the name of the binary generated by cargo.

Pip allows adding so called console scripts, which are shell commands that execute some function in you program. You can add console scripts in a section `[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]`. The keys are the script names while the values are the path to the function in the format `some.module.path:class.function`, where the `class` part is optional. The function is called with no arguments. Example:

```toml
[package.metadata.pyo3-pack.scripts]
get_42 = "my_project:DummyClass.get_42"
```

You can also specify [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) in your Cargo.toml under `package.metadata.pyo3-pack.classifier`, e.g.:

```toml
[package.metadata.pyo3-pack]
classifier = ["Programming Language :: Python"]
```

## pyo3 and rust-cpython

For pyo3 and rust-cpython, pyo3-pack can only build packages for installed python versions. On linux and mac, all python versions in `PATH` are used. If you don't set your own interpreters with `-i`, a heuristic is used to search for python installations. On windows all versions from the python launcher (which is installed by default by the python.org installer) and all conda environments except base are used. You can check which versions are picked up with the `list-python` subcommand.

pyo3 will set the used python interpreter in the environment variable `PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE`, which can be used from custom build scripts.

## Cffi

 Cffi wheels are compatible with all python versions, but they need to have `cffi` installed for the python used for building (`pip install cffi`).

pyo3-pack will run cbindgen and generate cffi bindings. You can override this with a build script that writes a header to `target/header.h`.

<details>
<summary>Example of a custom build script</summary>

```rust
use cbindgen; // Use `extern crate cbindgen` in rust 2015
use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    let bindings = cbindgen::Builder::new()
        .with_no_includes()
        .with_language(cbindgen::Language::C)
        .with_crate(crate_dir)
        .generate()
        .unwrap();
    bindings.write_to_file(Path::new("target").join("header.h"));
}
```

</details>

## Mixed rust/python projects

To create a mixed rust/python project, create a folder with your module name (i.e. `lib.name` in Cargo.toml) next to your Cargo.toml and add your python sources there:

```
my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── bar.py
├── Readme.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

pyo3-pack will add the native extension as a module in your python folder. When using develop, pyo3-pack will copy the native library and for cffi also the glue code to your python folder. You should add those files to your gitignore.

With cffi you can do `from .my_project import lib` and then use `lib.my_native_function`, with pyo3/rust-cpython you can directly `from .my_project import my_native_function`.

Example layout with pyo3 after `pyo3-pack develop`:

```
my-project
├── Cargo.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── bar.py
│   └── my_project.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
├── Readme.md
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

## pyproject.toml

pyo3-pack supports building through pyproject.toml. To use it, create a `pyproject.toml` next to your `Cargo.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["pyo3-pack", "toml"]
build-backend = "pyo3_pack"
```

If a `pyproject.toml` with a `[build-system]` entry is present, pyo3-pack will build a source distribution (sdist) of your package, unless `--no-sdist` is specified. The source distribution will contain the same files as `cargo package`.

You can then e.g. install your package with `pip install .`. With `pip install . -v` you can see the output of cargo and pyo3-pack.

You can use the options `manylinux`, `skip-auditwheel`, `bindings`, `strip`, `cargo-extra-args` and `rustc-extra-args` under `[tool.pyo3-pack]` the same way you would when running pyo3-pack directly.  The `bindings` key is required for cffi and bin projects as those can't be automatically detected. Currently, all build are in release mode (see [this thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-517-debug-vs-release-builds/1924) for details).

For a non-manylinux build you could with cffi bindings you could use the following:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["pyo3-pack", "toml"]
build-backend = "pyo3_pack"

[tool.pyo3-pack]
bindings = "cffi"
manylinux = "off"
```

Using tox with build isolation is currently blocked by a tox bug ([tox-dev/tox#1344](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1344)). There's a `cargo sdist` command for only building a source distribution as workaround for [pypa/pip#6041](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041).

## Manylinux and auditwheel

For portability reasons, native python modules on linux must only dynamically link a set of very few libraries which are installed basically everywhere, hence the name manylinux. The pypa offers a special docker container and a tool called [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/) to ensure compliance with the [manylinux rules](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/#the-manylinux1-policy).

pyo3-pack contains a reimplementation of a major part of auditwheel automatically checking the generated library. If you want to disable those checks or build for native linux target, use the `--manylinux` flag.

For full manylinux compliance you need to compile in a cent os 5 docker container. The [konstin2/pyo3-pack](https://hub.docker.com/r/konstin2/pyo3-pack) image is based on the official manylinux image. You can use it like this:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io konstin2/pyo3-pack build
```

pyo3-pack itself is manylinux compliant when compiled for the musl target. The binaries on the release pages have additional keyring integration (through the `password-storage` feature), which is not manylinux compliant.

## PyPy

pyo3-pack can build wheels for pypy with pyo3. Note that pypy [is not compatible with manylinux1](https://github.com/antocuni/pypy-wheels#why-not-manylinux1-wheels) and you can't publish pypy wheel to pypi pypy has been only tested manually and on linux. See [#115](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3-pack/issues/115) for more details.

## Code

The main part is the pyo3-pack library, which is completely documented and should be well integratable. The accompanying `main.rs` takes care username and password for the pypi upload and otherwise calls into the library.

The `sysconfig` folder contains the output of `python -m sysconfig` for different python versions and platform, which is helpful during development.

You need to install `cffi` (`pip install cffi`) to run the tests.

You might want to have look into my [blog post](https://blog.schuetze.link/2018/07/21/a-dive-into-packaging-native-python-extensions.html) which explains the intricacies of building native python packages.
