### Removed

 * Python 2 support
 * The custom progress bar was removed and cargo's output is shown instead

## [0.5.0]

### Added

 * Support for conda environments on windows by paddyhoran [#52](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/pull/52)
 * maturin will generate a header for cffi crates using cbinding, which means you don't need a `build.rs` anymore. The option to provide your own header file using a `build.rs` still exists.
 * The [konstin2/maturin](https://cloud.docker.com/u/konstin2/repository/docker/konstin2/maturin) docker image makes it easy to build fully manylinux compliant wheels. See the readme for usage details.
 * Support for manylinux2010 by ijl [#70](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/pull/70)
 * The `--manxlinux=[1|1-unchecked|2010|2010-unchecked|off]` option allows to build for manylinux1 and manylinux2010, both with audithweel (`1` or `2010`) and without (`1-unchecked` or `2010-unchecked`), but also for the native linux tag with `off`.

### Changed

 * The `--skip-auditwheel` flag has been deprecated in favor of `--manxlinux=[1|1-unchecked|2010|2010-unchecked|off]`.
 * Switched to rustls. This means the upload feature can be used from the docker container and builds of maturin itself are manylinux compliant when compiled with the musl target.

## [0.4.1] - 2018-12-15

### Changed

 * Musl and auditwheel compliance: Using the new `musl` feature combined with the musl target, you can build completely static binaries. The `password-storage`, which enables keyring integration, is now disabled by default. The Pypi packages are now statically linked with musl so that they are audtiwheel compliant.
 * Replaced `--debug` with `--release`. All builds are now debug by default
