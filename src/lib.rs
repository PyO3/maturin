//! Builds wheels from a crate that exposes python bindings through pyo3
//!
//! The high-level api is [BuildOptions], which can be converted into the [BuildContext], which
//! then uses [compile()] and builds the appropriate wheels.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - upload: Uses rewqest to add the upload command. By default this uses native openssl and
//! is therefore not manylinux comopliant
//!
//! - musl: Switches from native openssl to statically linked openssl, which makes the upload
//! feature manylinux compliant
//!
//! - password-storage (off by default): Uses the keyring package to store the password. keyring
//! pulls in a lot of shared libraries and outdated dependencies, so this is off by default, except
//! for the build on the github releases page.
//! (https://github.com/hwchen/secret-service-rs/issues/9)
//
//! - auditwheel: Reimplements the more important part of the auditwheel
//! package in rust. Every  wheel is check unless [skip_auditwheel](BuildContext.skip_auditwheel) is
//! set to true.
//!
//! - sdist: Allows creating sdist archives. Those archives can not be
//! installed yet, since (at least in the current 10.0.1) doesn't implement
//! PEP 517 and pyo3-pack doesn't implement the build backend api from that
//! PEP. It is therefore disabled by default. It also currently requires
//! nightly as it uses pyo3 for bindings and setting the crate type for lib to
//! rlib and cdylib.
//!
//! - human-panic: Adds human-panic, pulling in some outdated dependencies
//! (https://github.com/rust-clique/human-panic/pull/47)
