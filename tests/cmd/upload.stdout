Upload python packages to pypi

It is mostly similar to `twine upload`, but can only upload python wheels and source distributions.

Usage: maturin[EXE] upload [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

Arguments:
  [FILE]...
          The python packages to upload

Options:
  -r, --repository <REPOSITORY>
          The repository (package index) to upload the package to. Should be a section in the config
          file.
          
          Can also be set via MATURIN_REPOSITORY environment variable.
          
          [env: MATURIN_REPOSITORY=]
          [default: pypi]

      --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL>
          The URL of the registry where the wheels are uploaded to. This overrides --repository.
          
          Can also be set via MATURIN_REPOSITORY_URL environment variable.
          
          [env: MATURIN_REPOSITORY_URL=]
